## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.0]: Dark theme for all games — match homepage unified feel
- [v1.0]: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, GitHub Pages constraint
- [v1.1]: MIDI → MP3 via soundfonts — better audio than oscillator synthesis
- [v1.1]: Merge Strings/Synth/Other into closest groups — keep 6 rounds
- [v1.1]: Python build pipeline before game UI — audio assets first

### Pending Todos

None yet.
